# Mitigating data replication in text-to-audio generative diffusion models through anti-memorization guidance
[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-Paper-<COLOR>.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14934) *Francisco Messina, Francesca Ronchini, Luca Comanducci, Paolo Bestagini, Fabio Antonacci*

This repository accompains the the paper *[Mitigating data replication in text-to-audio generative diffusion models through anti-memorization guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14934)*. It builds on Stability AIâ€™s Stable Audio Open 1.0 and adds *Anti-Memorization Guidance (AMG)* during sampling. 
  -  In the folder _code_ you can find the code used to perform the experiments and also the plots included in the paper.
  -  In the folder _docs_ you can find the additional material, which is also nicely presented in the accompanying webpage 
References to the paper and base model are at the end of this document.
